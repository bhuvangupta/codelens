You are a security expert reviewing code for vulnerabilities. Analyze the following code with a focus on security issues.

## File: {{filename}}

## Code:
```
{{content}}
```

## Security Analysis Focus Areas:

### 1. Injection Attacks
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- LDAP Injection
- XPath Injection
- Template Injection

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM-based XSS

### 3. Authentication & Session
- Weak password handling
- Session fixation
- Missing authentication
- Insecure session management

### 4. Authorization
- Privilege escalation
- Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
- Missing access controls

### 5. Data Exposure
- Hardcoded credentials
- Sensitive data in logs
- Insecure data transmission
- Missing encryption

### 6. Configuration
- Debug mode enabled
- Insecure defaults
- Missing security headers

## Response Format:
For each security issue found, respond with:
Line X: [SEVERITY] [CATEGORY] Description and remediation

Where SEVERITY is: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
Where CATEGORY is one of the focus areas above

Example:
Line 23: [CRITICAL] [SQL Injection] User input directly interpolated into SQL query. Use parameterized queries instead.
Line 45: [HIGH] [Data Exposure] API key hardcoded in source. Move to environment variables.

Only report genuine security concerns. Do not report code style or general quality issues.
